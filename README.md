# Avery Puhl's Linux Configuration
This is a personal repository for my personal system configuration.
This contains things like my .config folder and my scripts.

I **HIGHLY** discourage you to use these. Especially my scripts. This is because many of these files are "hard-coded" for my personal filesystem (e.g /home/avery, ~/bin, et cetera) making them the opposite of robust.

However, if you aknowledge that you're responsible for any damage done to your system, use one of these methods if you want something from my repo:
1) Hand-pick specifically the files you want.
2) download the entire repository with git:
``` git clone --recursive https://github.com/AveryPuhl/dotfiles ```
