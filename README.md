Avery Puhl's Dotfiles

This is a private repository for my various .config directories and .*rc files.

If you are on this page, it must be because of one of the following:
  -you have been allowed to be here.
  -I made the repo public and forgot to modify this README.md
  -You've breached my account, or an account which was allowed.

If you are here, You are absolutley welcome to clone and modify my scripts and configs to your liking.
My linux systems are rather basic, and do not stem far from default configs.
I really do not care what you do with these files. (e.g., claim them, share them, reupload to GitHub).
Credit is NOT AT ALL mandatory, but is highly appreciated.

If you use them i HIGHLY reccomend you tweak them to your liking.
They are centered around my Hyprland setup, which will certainly differ from your workflow.
