# *Avery Puhl's Desktop Linux Configuration*
This contains config files and shell scripts belonging to my personal Archlinux system configuration.

I ***highly*** discourage you to use my scripts (found in ~/bin). Many of these scripts are the opposite of robust (e.g hard-coded file paths, bugs, et cetera), and I cannot recommend any usage.

I will ***NOT*** help you if you break your system, somehow.
