# Avery Puhl's Dotfiles
This is a personal repository for my .config directories and .*rc shell files.
If you use them I HIGHLY reccomend you tweak them to your liking.
### You are absolutley welcome to clone, use, and modify this Repository.
I really do not care what you do with these files. (e.g., claim them, share them, reupload to GitHub).
Do whatever you please with this repository. I encourage it.
##### Credit is NOT mandatory, but is highly appreciated.
My linux systems are rather basic, and do not stem very far from default configs.
You'll find various comments throughout my configs labeling details.
These stem from previous versions/users of these files, myself included.
### Expect incompatibilities on non-Archlinux systems!
I use **vanilla Arch linux**, and have not tested nor optimized for use on other distributions.
I primarily use Hyprland, which may not be your perferred Compositor/Enviroment.
### If you happen to load my Hyprland config before modifying:
~ SUPER+Home to launch a Kitty terminal.
~ SUPER+delete to logout back to your tty/Display Manager.
~ SUPER+T to open Firefox.
